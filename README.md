# Task Description

Write a ToDo web application without a server.

The Application should provide the following functionality:

- Add a task with title
- Task list is sorted in reverse order by the task title
- Edit a task
- Mark a task as completed
- Remove a task
- Persist tasks between working sessions (it could be LocalStorage)
  Note: it is ok for a "customer" if you do something quickly and provide additional features, but there will be no penalties if you don't.

Business context:

- Goal is the time to market
- Be ready to change something minor fast in the future

Non-Functional Requirements:

- Test task should be presented as a git repository with a history of changes. it could be located on GitHub (preferred) or folder with .git metadata.
- Application should be written on JavaScript, frameworks are up to developer.
- This task should take no more than 6-8 working hours(it is better to be less).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`
